#> Player tag managment per bot

# Basically im planning to make something like that
#> 1. Player will be tagged when close to a nextbot with for example metalpipe_d
#> 2. Separate texturepack with jumpscares sprites will be added (less messy!) - 
#> 3. Player will be alive 2/3 seconds while playing the jumpscare
#> After that the tag will be removed and the player will be killed

# In short maybe it wont be like in possession datapack and maybe i will somehow create universal script for that stuff
# Time will tell!
