<p align="center">Texturepack & Datapacks for our server - Niko's Nextbots</p>


[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/Nik0-0/projects/1/views/1)

## Description

Welcome to the Nico's Nextbots Texture Pack! This is the texture pack used in our server. Any edits in the master branch will be applied in our server. In that way, we can add new bots and features easier + with the help of community.

## Before we start....

A basic knowledge of understanding and editing .json files is required | [Learn More](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Font).
This used to be a part of the "VibeCraft" server. That's why the folder is named like that. Don't change the structure of this pack, even if its messy. This is planned for the v2.0 server version.

### Pack Structure
Most important folders:

- [Nextbots Textures](https://github.com/Nikos-Stuff/nikosnextbots/tree/main/main/assets/vibecraft/textures/nextbots)

Used for nextbot textures / animations. [Remember that you need to also implement it in the font file!](https://github.com/Nikos-Stuff/nikosnextbots/blob/main/main/assets/minecraft/font/default.json)
You also need to use unicode characters from [here](https://unicode.bayashi.net/?page=1900). (Make sure that they're not used already)

*Note: 256 x 256 .png format required. For animated bots please create a new folder and place frames inside (max 5 frames)*

- [Events Textures](https://github.com/Nikos-Stuff/nikosnextbots/tree/main/main/assets/vibecraft/textures/events)
 
Used for full screen events like angry munci etc.

You also need to use unicode characters from [here](https://unicode.bayashi.net/?page=1900). (Make sure that they're not used already)

*Note: 256 x 256 .png format required. Create a new folder and place the images inside (max 5 frames for animation)*

- [Sounds](https://github.com/Nikos-Stuff/nikosnextbots/tree/main/main/assets/vibecraft/sounds)

Please use the .ogg stereo or mono based on your need. For example:

- For a sound effect that plays use stereo

- For a nextbot sounds use mono

After everything done. Don't forget to add your sound to [sounds.json](https://github.com/Nikos-Stuff/nikosnextbots/blob/main/main/assets/vibecraft/sounds.json)!

*Note: Place your file in the correct folder. Don't make a mess!*
